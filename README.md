# jQuery History Plugin

jQuery history plugin helps you to support back/forward buttons and bookmarks in your javascript applications.
You can store the application state into URL hash and restore the state from it.

## Supported Browsers

- Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8+
- Safari 4 and 5+
- Google Chrome 4+

This plugin is built on hashchange event, which is defined in HTML5 and supported in most modern browsers.
Unless it is supported the plugin works on some fallback mechanisms:

- monitoring location.hash by setInterval (Safari 4)
- iframe and setInterval (IE 6, 7, and compatibility mode on IE8)
